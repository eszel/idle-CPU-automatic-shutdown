# idle-CPU-automatic-shutdown

It's a very tiny freeware Windows desktop application. It can automatically shutdown your PC, when it finished some work, detecting constant low CPU usage.

If your CPU is under 10% for more than 10 seconds, it shuts down your PC.

## Installation and usage

Just [download](Win32/Release/IdleCPUAutomaticShutdown.exe) the latest portable exe (hit raw button), run, and click start.. 
You can place the exe file somewhere for later use and also create an icon maybe.. :)
